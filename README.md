# Linear-Regression-project
 Linear Regression Project on Sales and Advertising dataset 
 using numpy,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib libraries.
 The mini project was done to explore and learn data analysis using
 numpy,pandas,matplotlib and seaborn libraries in python.
 It also helped me to learn and build the Linear Regression Model
 and calculate Errors and Accuracy scores.
